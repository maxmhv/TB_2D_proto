# TB_2D_proto
Turn-based 2D game prototype


This is a hobby/school project I did for my Bachelor's Thesis as my first game project with C# and Unity. Not optimized or finished, but the core gameplay loop (that is, the turn-based combat) is working without any major issues, albeit being a little clunky. I might update it every now and then, if I have time and am not immersed in other projects.

I have uploaded only the script files, so if you want to have a play with them in Unity, you'll have to do some assinging in the inspector/have approriate assets ready to use, such as prefabs for the enemy/player characters or the health bars, to attach the scripts to. I'll try to make it clear in the scripts themselves what everything does, but if you need extra guidance, I recommend you check out sources below for more in-depth explanations. I used these to get started with my initial prototype, and then modified and added my own code to get the prototype working more like I wanted it to.

Here's a short video demo of the prototype, if you want to take a peek what the code looks like in action. And please ignore the graphics, I spent less than two hours to make them (and didn't want to use pre-made assets)!
